# ToDoList

A To-Do List GUI application built using PyQt5, allowing users to create, edit, delete, and manage tasks.
The app supports task categorization by All Tasks, Today’s Tasks, and Completed Tasks, with an integrated calendar for setting due dates.

## 🚀 Features

🧾 Add Tasks: Create new tasks with a name, description, and optional due date.

📅 Calendar Integration: Choose task dates using a popup calendar widget.

✅ Mark as Complete: Move tasks to the "Completed" tab once finished.

✏️ Edit Tasks: Quickly edit task details.

🗑️ Delete Tasks: Remove tasks individually.

🧠 Tabbed Interface: View tasks across three tabs:

- All Tasks
- Today’s Tasks
- Completed Tasks

## UI Files

The project uses Qt Designer .ui files for UI design:

tab_task_file.ui → Main To-Do List window (contains all tabs and frames)

Add_Task_file.ui → Add/Edit Task window

You must ensure these .ui files exist at the correct file paths before running the code.
